    <p style="color:white"> internet is a storehouse of today's world.it has become one of the main facto methods used in communication.And out of which one is email which is one of the most common in every aspect of business world.However not all can make use of its as untill it's not visible it's of no use.This makes a completely useless technology for visually impaired and illeterated people.Emails are considered to be most reliable way of communication over internet,for sending and receving mails,but there is special criteria for humans to access,you must be able to think that waht sort of criteria is this,everyone with eyes can see.But there are some visuallly challlanged people or blind people who can't see computer screen and keyboard.A survey shows more than 250 million visually challenged people around the globe.So for the betterment of society and giving an equal status status to such specially abled people we have come up with this project idea which provides the user the users with ability to send emails using voice commands without the need of keyboard or any other visual things</p>
